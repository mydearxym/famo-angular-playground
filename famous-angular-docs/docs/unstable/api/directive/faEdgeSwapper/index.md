  fa-edge-swapper



</h1>





This directive is used to hook a Famo.us EdgeSwapper into AngularJS ngAnimate events.  For example, you can apply an fa-edge-swapper directive
to a `<ui-view>` or an `<ng-include>` in order to quickly and easily add EdgeSwapper transitions to template changes in those directives.
Supports the `fa-options` directive for setting options.  Does NOT support sitting on the same element as another fa- element
